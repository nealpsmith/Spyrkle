# Spyrkle
Static documentation is great because it never changes, it can be archived and sent to collegues.
There's no better way to keep a clean record of your amazing experiments and results.

Current version allows you to create paginated notebooks containing images (from urls), code and graphs (like Deep Learning models from pyTorch for example). In the future I may add support for static images and plots, and embedding in Jupyter notebooks.

**Spyrkle** is still a work in progress, full documentation will be avaiblable soon.However, if you're here for pyTorch network visualization please take a look a the demos folder. There are nice examples waiting there for you.

Contributions welcome!

# Installation

* Clone it
* Go into the Spyrkle folder
* Do *python setup.py develop*

As always it is highly recommended to install Spyrkle inside a virtual environement. Use conda, it's better.
